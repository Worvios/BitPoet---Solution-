    "paragraphs": [
      "BitPoet began as an experiment in combining poetry, code, and play. I wanted to know whether software could feel like a story—whether an interface could hold the same gravity as a line of verse. Every prototype was a meditation on texture, timing, and the emotional arc of interaction.",
      "Over the years, that experiment became a studio. I partnered with founders, artists, and technologists who believed that rigor and soul can coexist. We shipped tools for thinkers, games for storytellers, and brand experiences that carried the warmth of human craft.",
      "My philosophy is simple: ship with intention. I treat every deliverable like a piece of literature—drafted, edited, and scored for impact. The engineering is meticulous, the design is luminous, and the copy is tuned for resonance.",
      "Today, BitPoet blends deep technical capability with narrative intuition. Whether I am orchestrating an immersive game mechanic or building a high-performance design system, the through-line is the same: create work that moves hearts while it moves product metrics.",
      "If you are chasing an ambitious idea and crave a partner who can translate it into a living, breathing experience, let’s compose it together."
